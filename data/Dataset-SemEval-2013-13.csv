These xenobiotic activators are referred to as "phenobarbital (PB) - like," based on the prototypic effects of the anti-epileptic agent on drug metabolism [ 12 13 14 ] .

When looking for IL-8 at the G1/S border, we found that all Tat containing cells, including PBMCs that were treated with exogenous Tat showed an up-regulation of IL-8 in the supernatant (Figure 4), further implying that results obtained from the H9/Tat system may infact be of general physiological relevance in vivo.
